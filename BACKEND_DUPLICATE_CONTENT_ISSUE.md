# Backend Issue: Duplicate Content in SPoints

## Problem Description
When fetching spoints from the API (`GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/spoints`), the `default_content` field contains duplicate lines. For example, the same sentence appears twice in the content.

## Observed Behavior
1. **Initial Load**: Content shows duplicates (e.g., same sentence twice)
2. **After 5 seconds**: One duplicate disappears (EditorJS cleans it and auto-save updates it)
3. **Result**: Content is corrected client-side, but the root issue is in the backend

## Questions for Backend Team

### 1. Database Content Storage
**Question**: How is the `default_content` stored in the `spoints` table?

Please run this query and check:
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    default_content,
    LENGTH(default_content) as content_length
FROM spoints 
WHERE default_content IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;
```

**What to check**: 
- Is the content stored with duplicate lines?
- Are there any newline characters (`\n`) that might cause duplication?

### 2. Content Generation Process
**Question**: How is content added to spoints when they are created or expanded?

Please check:
- Is content copied from points to spoints?
- Is there any concatenation happening during expansion?
- Is the same content being appended multiple times?

### 3. API Response Building
**Question**: Is there any processing/formatting of the `default_content` field when building the API response?

Check the code that:
- Retrieves spoints from database
- Formats the response
- Serializes the content field

### 4. Specific Example Needed
Can you provide the raw database content for one spoint that shows duplicates?

Run this query:
```sql
SELECT 
    es.id as expanded_spoint_id,
    sp.name,
    sp.default_content,
    HEX(sp.default_content) as hex_content
FROM expanded_spoints es
JOIN spoints sp ON es.spoint_id = sp.id
WHERE es.session_id = '67551157-da02-45d5-afde-d6ce088eb1f8'
LIMIT 1;
```

The HEX output will show us exactly what characters are in the content.

### 5. Content Source
**Question**: Where does the `default_content` come from originally?

- Is it manually entered?
- Is it generated from another source?
- Is it imported from files?
- Is there a template or pattern being used?

### 6. Duplication Pattern
**Question**: Is the duplication always exactly the same pattern?

For example:
- Is it always the entire content duplicated?
- Is it specific lines that get duplicated?
- Is it related to newline characters?

## Current Frontend Behavior

The frontend currently:
1. Receives the content with duplicates
2. Displays it in EditorJS
3. EditorJS automatically cleans duplicates (unintended side effect)
4. Auto-saves the cleaned version after 5 seconds

## Expected Backend Fix

The backend should:
1. **Identify** where the duplication occurs (database, API, or generation)
2. **Fix** the root cause to prevent future duplications
3. **Clean** existing data if needed
4. **Ensure** each spoint has unique, non-duplicated content

## Test Case

To verify the issue is fixed:
1. Call `GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/spoints`
2. Check each spoint's `default_content`
3. Ensure no lines are duplicated within the content
4. Verify content displays correctly without any client-side cleaning

## Temporary Frontend Workaround

Currently, we're NOT implementing a workaround because:
- It would mask the real issue
- EditorJS is already inadvertently cleaning the content
- We need to fix the root cause in the backend

## Priority
**HIGH** - This affects content quality and user experience. Students see duplicate content initially which is confusing.

## Additional Information Needed

Please provide:
1. The exact database schema for `spoints` and `expanded_spoints` tables
2. The code that generates/inserts content into spoints
3. The API endpoint code that retrieves and formats spoints
4. Any content processing/transformation logic

With this information, we can identify exactly where the duplication occurs and fix it properly.
