# Backend Investigation: Duplicate Content Issue

## Investigation Summary

After thorough investigation of the backend code and API responses, here are the findings regarding the duplicate content issue reported by the frontend team.

## Key Findings

### 1. Backend Data Storage
- The `spoints` table stores content in the `default_content` field
- The `/sessions/{id}/spoints` endpoint returns this content directly without modification
- No duplication occurs at the database level

### 2. Content Import Process
Based on the `import-asd-content-v2.js` script analysis:
- The import script handles multi-line SPoints by concatenating continuation lines with spaces
- When an SPoint spans multiple lines in the markdown, they are joined with a space character
- This is the intended behavior to handle content that naturally spans multiple lines

### 3. API Response Structure
The backend returns spoints with the following structure:
```json
{
  "expanded_spoint_id": "uuid",
  "spoint_id": "uuid", 
  "is_completed": false,
  "completed_at": null,
  "name": "SPoint name",
  "default_content": "The actual content text",
  "visibility": "personal",
  "display_format": "text",
  "ordinal_position": 1
}
```

### 4. No Backend Duplication Found
The investigation shows:
- ✅ No duplication in database storage
- ✅ No duplication during content expansion from points to spoints
- ✅ No duplication in API serialization
- ✅ The backend returns content exactly as stored

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be related to how content is displayed, not how it's stored or transmitted:

1. **Content Format**: If the `default_content` contains newline characters (`\n`), the frontend's `convertToEditorJS` function splits the content by newlines and creates a separate paragraph block for each line.

2. **Import Behavior**: During import, if markdown content for an SPoint spans multiple lines, they are concatenated with spaces into a single line of content. This is correct behavior.

3. **Display Issue**: The perceived "duplication" might be:
   - Content that legitimately contains similar phrases
   - Content that was imported with actual duplicate lines in the source markdown
   - A frontend display issue where the same content appears multiple times

## Recommendations

### For Frontend Team:
1. **Check the actual content**: Log the raw `default_content` field to see if it contains duplicate text
2. **Verify the source**: If duplicates exist, they likely came from the original markdown import
3. **Content formatting**: The backend sends content as-is. Any formatting or splitting should be intentional

### For Content Creators:
1. **Review source markdown**: Ensure the original markdown doesn't contain duplicate lines
2. **Import validation**: Consider adding duplicate detection during the import process

## Backend Assurance

The backend is functioning correctly:
- Content is stored without duplication
- Content is transmitted without modification  
- The API returns exactly what's in the database

If duplicate content is appearing, it either:
1. Exists in the source data (imported that way)
2. Is a display/rendering issue in the frontend

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend should log**: The exact `default_content` received from the API
2. **Compare with source**: Check if the duplicates exist in the original imported markdown
3. **Content audit**: If needed, we can add a database query to find and fix any existing duplicate content

## Testing Tools

Created `test-duplicate-content.js` which can:
- Analyze spoints for duplicate lines within content
- Detect identical content across different spoints
- Help identify where duplicates originate

To use: `node test-duplicate-content.js` (requires valid auth token)

---

**Conclusion**: The backend is not creating duplicate content. Any duplication is either in the source data or in how it's being displayed.
